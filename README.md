Tired of losing track of the recipes you sent to friends over Instagram? Or was it text? Or TikTok? Dinner Tonight fixes that by giving you a single location to save and organize your recipes, as well as share them with friends.

This is an (in-production) recipe saving and sharing app created with React Native and Expo.
