# Dinner Tonight?

Tired of losing track of the recipes you sent to friends over Instagram? Or was it text? Or TikTok? Dinner Tonight fixes that by giving you a single location to save and organize your recipes, as well as share them with friends.

This is an (in-production) recipe saving and sharing app created with React Native and Expo.

## Built With
- React Native
- Expo
- Firebase (for auth and data)
- React Navigation
- TypeScript

## Get started
While this app can be downloaded and run locally using Expo, it will soon be on the iOS App Store, and possibly the Google Play Store.

You may need to install expo on your computer:
```
npm i expo
```

To run via Expo, download the repo onto your computer and type in the following
```
npx expo start
```
The following directions will then be displayed in your terminal:
```
› Press a │ open Android
› Press i │ open iOS simulator
› Press w │ open web

› Press j │ open debugger
› Press r │ reload app
› Press m │ toggle menu
› shift+m │ more tools
› Press o │ open project code in your editor

› Press ? │ show all commands
```

To run this project, you’ll  also need to add your Firebase config or API keys in an `.env` file.

Example:
```
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_API_KEY=your_key_here
EXPO_PUBLIC_FIREBASE_AUTH_DOMAIN=your_domain_here
```
